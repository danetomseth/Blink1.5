# Blink1.5

Blink is an open-source assistive communication tool developed for individuals living with paralysis or Locked-In Syndrome (LIS).

Our primary design goal was to transform complex computer vision into a simple, self-configuring communication app navigable solely with eye blinks and able to run on low-resolution webcams.

Key features include:
* Customizable eye, pupil, brow and mouth tracking to give a range of interactive options depending on the severity of paralysis
* Automatic calibration to personalize responsiveness to each user's unique range of motion and abilities
* Multiple keyboard types and layouts to accommodate personal preferences and communication styles
* Autocomplete and next-word prediction capacities which learn over time
* Basic real-time chat to connect users with each other

NOTE: This app utilizes clmtrackr.js for feature tracking.
